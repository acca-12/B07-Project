	-Fully implemented student login and registration with firebase authentication and real-time database
    - Users can now create a new student account, which adds the account to firebase auth and all the account info to the realtime database
    - once logged in, users are redirected to student landing page, where currently only the Student account user ID is provided
      - this user id can be used to retrieve the rest of the account information

  - fully implement admin login system, similar to student login system
