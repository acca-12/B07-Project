Name: <JS Dandurand>

What have you done since yesterday?
   - refactored firebase database storage to store unique Course IDs as elements in the Courses list rather than the course code
   	- this is done so that when admins update course info, no updates are required on the side of the students
   - refacted Course.java and AddCourse.java accordingly to this change, which included figuring out an algorithm to determine a Course's ID given
   its code.
   	- part of this refactoring also included ensuring prerequisites for courses were also stored on firebase as Course IDs rather than course codes,
	once again so that these fields would not have to be updated in the event that an admin updated a course's info
	

What are you planning on doing today?
  - Once Admin manage courses page is implemented, I plan to work on Admin edit course

Any impediments or stumbling blocks?
